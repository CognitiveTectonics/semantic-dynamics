# Cognitive Tectonics (CT)

**Cognitive Tectonics** is a descriptive theory of how **tension** drives **semantic motion**, and how repeated motion under pressure **crystallizes** into reusable **cognitive artifacts**.

It serves as the foundational "physics" for understanding cognitive stability. It provides the vocabulary to describe how raw information flows are squeezed, filtered, and solidified, without prescribing specific software implementations.

## Why "Tectonics"?

We previously called this framework *Semantic Dynamics*. However, "Dynamics" only describes how things flow (like a fluid). 

**Tectonics** describes how things **form** (like a mountain).
In this theory, we view thought not just as a stream, but as a geological process:
* **Tension** is the stress between shifting plates.
* **Semantic Motion** is the resulting quake or drift.
* **Crystallization** is the formation of stable bedrock (Artifacts) that reshapes the future landscape.

**We don't just want to watch the flow; we want to understand the structure.**

## The Core Loop (The Theory)

The mechanism of CT is a continuous cycle of pressure and solidification:

```text
[Tension] → [Semantic Motion] → [Distillation] → [Crystallization] → [Artifact]
    ^                                                    |
    |                                                    v
    +--------- (Artifact reshapes future Tension) -------+
```

- **Tension**: The unresolved pull, conflict, or ambiguity (The Driver).
- **Semantic Motion**: The generation of new meaning or options (The Flow).
- **Crystallization**: The solidification of motion into reusable structures (The Outcome).

## From Theory to Architecture

While **CT** describes the physics, we need a specific architecture to apply it to Generative AI. This is where the **Portable Cognitive Reference (PCR)** comes in.

By applying CT principles, the PCR acts as a **"Cognitive Reference"** to achieve **Cognitive Locking**:

1.  **Portable Cognitive Reference (PCR):** The crystallized bedrock of axioms and values.
2.  **Reasoning Circuit (RC):** The topology that forces the AI to resolve tension against your reference.
3.  **Cognitive Frequency (CF):** The final, locked-in output that carries your unique signature.

> *"CT explains the physics. PCR implements the lock."*
