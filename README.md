# Semantic Dynamics (SD)

**Semantic Dynamics** is a theory of how **tension** drives **semantic motion**, and how repeated motion **crystallizes** into reusable **cognitive artifacts**.

It serves as the foundational "physics" for describing cognitive processes in humans and AI agents, providing a shared vocabulary (Tension, Mismatches, Crystallization) without prescribing specific tooling or software implementation.

## The Core Loop
`Tension → Semantic Motion → Distillation → Crystallization (Artifact)`
